# Yarrtorio

Desktop Factorio mod downloader and manager built with Electron, Vite, React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and daisyUI.

## Overview

Yarrtorio is a desktop app for browsing Factorio mods, viewing release details, queuing downloads, syncing against `mod-list.json`, and managing installed mod archives from a local mods folder.

The app uses Electron for the desktop shell, a React renderer for the UI, and a preload bridge plus IPC handlers to keep the renderer isolated from Node.js and file-system access.


## Features

* Browse Factorio mods with search, tabs, category filters, tag filters, version filters, and pagination
* View full mod details, releases, dependencies, images, source/homepage/license links, and descriptions
* Queue downloads for a selected version, with optional dependency downloads
* Track download state for queued, running, completed, failed, and cancelled downloads
* Read installed mods from a local Factorio mods folder
* Delete installed archives, queue updates, and toggle enabled state through `mod-list.json`
* Sync local downloads from `mod-list.json`
* Save local app settings such as mod folder, custom `mod-list.json` path, download concurrency, notification preference, and theme
* Cache mod browse datasets and mod details to reduce repeated portal/API calls
* Show desktop notifications when downloads complete or fail
* Package for Windows as both NSIS installer and portable build

## Tech Stack

* Electron
* electron-vite
* React 19
* TypeScript
* Tailwind CSS 4
* daisyUI 5
* Zod
* electron-builder

## How it works

### Renderer

The renderer hosts the dashboard, browse, installed, and settings pages. It keeps app state in a small store and uses feature hooks for settings and mod actions.

### Preload bridge

The preload layer exposes a typed `window.electronApi` surface for:

* app metadata
* mod browsing and management
* download queue operations
* settings read/write and file pickers
* opening external URLs

### Main process

The main process registers IPC handlers for:

* `mods:\*`
* `downloads:\*`
* `settings:\*`
* `app:\*`
* `external:\*`

It also owns filesystem access, notification dispatch, queue execution, mod-list mutation, and all requests to the Factorio mod portal/API.

## Requirements

* Node.js 20+ recommended
* npm
* Windows is the primary packaging target in the current config
* A valid Factorio mods folder for installed-mod management
* Network access to the Factorio Mod Portal/API for browse/details/download planning

## Getting Started

### 1\. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 2\. Start the app in development

```bash
npm run dev
```

### 3\. Configure settings in the app

Open **Settings** and set:

* **Mod Folder**: your local Factorio `mods` directory
* **mod-list.json path**: optional; leave empty to use `<modsFolder>/mod-list.json`

### 4\. Browse or sync mods

* Use **Browse** to search and inspect mods
* Use **Sync from mod-list** to queue mods from your Factorio mod list
* Use **Installed** to update, delete, or toggle installed mods

## Available Scripts

```bash
npm run dev        # start Electron + Vite dev mode
npm run build      # build main, preload, and renderer output
npm run preview    # preview the built app with electron-vite
npm run typecheck  # TypeScript check without emitting files
npm run dist       # build Windows NSIS + portable packages
```

## Settings

The app persists settings in Electron's `userData` directory. Current settings in source include:

* `modsFolder`
* `modListPath`
* `concurrency`
* `ignoreDisabledMods`
* `includeDisabledModsByDefault`
* `desktopNotifications`
* `theme`

## Download Behavior

Downloads are queued in the main process. The queue concurrency is configurable in Settings. When a download completes or fails, the main process can dispatch a desktop notification if notifications are enabled and supported by the OS.

## Data Sources

Yarrtorio consumes the Factorio Mod Portal/API for:

* browse datasets
* mod details
* release information
* dependency parsing inputs
* portal extras such as images, homepage/source/license links

## Packaging

The project is configured to produce Windows builds via `electron-builder`:

* NSIS installer
* Portable executable

Icons live under `resources/icons`.

## Notes for Contributors

### Add a new setting

Typical flow:

1. Add the field to `AppSettings`
2. Add validation/defaults in `settingsSchema`
3. Add default persistence in `settings-service`
4. Surface it in the renderer settings fallback/state
5. Add UI in `SettingsPage`
6. Actually consume the setting where behavior changes

### Add a new IPC action

Typical flow:

1. Add the channel to `src/shared/contracts/ipc-contracts.ts`
2. Expose it through preload
3. Implement the main-process handler
4. Register it in `register-ipc.ts`
5. Call it from renderer actions/hooks

## Current Gaps / Nice Next Steps

* better error reporting and structured logging (mayhaps)
* richer loading states and skeleton UI
* stronger end-to-end type-safe settings evolution/migrations (maybe)
* tests for reducers, mappers, and settings/mod parser flows
* Linux/macOS packaging if needed
* README badges, screenshots, and contribution guide (idk)

## Credits

This project started from a much simpler tool.

The original idea and early implementation were created by friends of mine as a PowerShell (.ps1) script that helped automate downloading locally.

That script inspired me to build a full desktop application around the same problem — improving usability, adding a graphical interface, download queueing, caching, settings management, and a more structured architecture.
